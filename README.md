# Readme

This is the complete code for my website.

The site is built using :

- Jekyll
- Bootstrap 3
- Less
- jQuery
- Owlcarousel
- Magnific popup
- Isotope
- Parallax.js
- jQuery SmoothScroll
- jQuery.equalheights

# Usage
Make sure you have installed npm, jekyll, grunt globally.

1. clone this repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `jekyll build`
4. run `npx grunt` (remove the 'uncss' task from default task for faster build while you dev)
4. run `jekyll serve`
